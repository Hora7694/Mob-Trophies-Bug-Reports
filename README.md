# 🛠️ Mob Trophies - Bug Tracker

> **Welcome to the official repository for reporting issues and suggesting improvements for the Mob Trophies Hytale Mod.**

This page is strictly dedicated to **tracking bugs** and **development progress**. If you encounter a problem in Orbis, you are in the right place to help us fix it.

## ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP)
**Important Note:** This mod is currently under development. Not all Hytale mobs are available yet. Bug reports are essential for us to improve the experience. New trophies and features are added regularly.

## 🔍 READ BEFORE REPORTING

Before creating a new issue (bug report), please check the following:
1. **Search existing issues:** Your bug might already be reported and numbered (#).
2. **Update your mod:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Mob Trophies.
3. **Be specific:** "It doesn't work" doesn't help. Tell us **what** happened and **how** it happened.
