> _Mob Trophies isn't a mod about cute decoration. It's about marking your territory. Every major creature in Orbis can now become a silent witness to your power._

**Mob Trophies** allows you to immortalize your victories. Don't just defeat your enemies: reclaim unique trophies directly from their remains. Whether it's placing a head on the ground, hanging it on the wall, or displaying a rare statuette, transform your base into a true museum of your finest hunts across the different zones of Orbis.
